    "This project is made in the frame of the EPFL course: Basics of Mobile Robotics (BoMR). The goal is to program a robot, the Thymio, to go from a specific point to another while avoiding the obstacles and surviving some kidnapping sessions. In order to achieve this, we used computer vision, filtering, global navigation and local navigation.\n",

    "As you can see, we are on a car racing circuit, where our beloved thymio is racing against the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our program uses an overhead camera to detect the obstacles, the track, the thymio and the finishing line. The global navigation part, anaibles to do path planning to reach the line (goal). Finally we have a Kalman filter, using the robot's poistion from the camera and odometry, allowing the thymio to know and correct its position in real time, even with a hidden camera."
