    "This project is made in the frame of the EPFL course: Basics of Mobile Robotics (BoMR). The goal is to program a robot, the Thymio, to go from a specific point to another while avoiding the obstacles and surviving some kidnapping sessions. In order to achieve this, we used computer vision, filtering, global navigation and local navigation.\n",

    "As you can see, we are on a car racing circuit, where our beloved thymio is racing against the clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our program uses an overhead camera to detect the obstacles, the track, the thymio and the finishing line. The global navigation part, anaibles to do path planning to reach the line (goal). Finally we have a Kalman filter, using the robot's poistion from the camera and odometry, allowing the thymio to know and correct its position in real time, even with a hidden camera."

    "    If a neighbor is not in the openSet, it is added. If the tentative gScore for a neighbor is lower than its current gScore, the algorithm updates the scores and backtracks the optimal path.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Reconstruction of Path:**\n",
    "    If the goal is reached, the *reconstruct_path* function is called to reconstruct the optimal path from the start to the goal using the information stored in the cameFrom dictionary.\n",
    "    The reconstructed path is returned along with the set of nodes that were visited during the algorithm (closedSet).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualization (Optional):**\n",
    "    The code includes optional visualization elements, such as displaying the visited nodes with a time delay 0f 0.05 seconds, to visualize the algorithm's progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error Handling:**\n",
    "    If the open set becomes empty and the goal has not been reached, a message is printed indicating that no path was found to the goal.\n"
